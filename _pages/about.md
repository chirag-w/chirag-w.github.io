I am a second-year PhD student in the School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom, advised by [Mina Doosti](https://minadoosti.github.io/) and [Myrto Arapinis](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/marapini/). I previously obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, India.

My research focuses on quantum learning theory, but I am broadly interested in various aspects of theoretical computer science and quantum information. Topics I'm currently exploring include:
- Testing and learning about quantum states and processes
- Quantum learning algorithms and lower bounds under restricted resources 
- Communication complexity of distributed learning tasks
